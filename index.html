        <div id="bio">
        <p>My name is Brendan McGinty, and I have spent my career working in consulting and finance. In college, I attended the Wharton Undergraduate School of Business where I was also a member of the Varsity Football team as well. After graduating in 2019, I worked as a management consultant for KPMG then transitioned to a role with Macquarie Asset Management.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I have recently started a full time, 3-month coding Bootcamp through UC Berkely to develop a suite of full stack development skills, and this page will be used as a portfolio of my work as I continue to develop and hone better skills. </p>
