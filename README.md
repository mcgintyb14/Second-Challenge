# Second-Challenge

## Description
This project represents the first working version of my personal portfolio which will continue to be devloped and improved over the course of the next three months. On this page, I have structured the page to follow the structure of the general mockup that was provided, and have added some creative touches to make the page more personalized.

At the top of the page, a header displays my name as well as three links to sections embedded within the page. The 'About Me' section gives a short biography of myself (which will likely be expanded throughout the course) to provide any visitors to the page a brief description of myself and my career experience prior to my software development journey. 

The section - and main - section of the page is the 'Work' section which displays pictures with links to my ongoing projects throughout the bootcamp. As of now, this only displays links to two projects I have completed so far titled 'Coding Study Guide' and 'Placeholder Marketing Site.' Both of these links work and will bring you to the Github repository for each of these projects. Lastly and purely for fun, I included two additional 'placeholder' projects that do not link to any specific page but will be filled in as more projects are completed throughout the course. Please enjoy the picture of my cat Nala as a placeholder for 'Pet Projects.'

The last section of the body of the page is the 'Contact Me' section which includes working links to my cell phone number, my email, and my Github account. This is to be used for any potential visitor to contact me as needed.

Note that I have also included multiple media queries for the page to help readability and usage for smaller screen resolutions. Also note that this does not strictly follow the breaks for popular devices, but rather has breaks that align with the page and structure itself. This is why the first break executes at a width of 1200px to reduce the overall font sizes as well as adjust the layout of the images in the 'Work' section, making them smaller and display as a flex column instead. 

Additional queries were added for 850px, 768px, and 692px to further reduce font sizes for smaller resolutions. 

## Installation
N/A: There are no installation instructions for this page as no downloads should be necessary

## Usage
To correctly navigate this page, you can either use the links in the header to navigate directly to a specifc section, or you can simply scroll down the page to see the three main sections. Note that each link in the header navigates you directly to the specified section embedded within the page.

In the 'Work' section, simply click on any of the images that represent different projects, and for the top two images titled 'Coding Study Guide' and 'Placeholder Marketing Site,' these should redirect you to a new tab that lands on my Github repository for the respective projects. 

NOTE: The bottom two images do not link anywhere and are used purely as placeholders.
